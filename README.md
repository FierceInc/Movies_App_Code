# Tools Used

With this project I used **TMDb** for the movie data and **ExpressJS** for the Server and **Express Router** for routing to different End-Points, **JavaScript-Fetch** to collect all the the data I needed, **EJS** to render the data to the screen and display pages, and the youtube API to imbed the youtube player into my app.

# Process

Buiding this took me a bit over 3 months as I had to learn most of the stuff and there were a lot of bugs to begin with especially with the routing and parsing of data.
In most cases I would debug the code mainly by printing out the results to the console, and going through the TMDb documentation over and over just to figure out what I was doing wrong. And also looked at other movie sites just to get and idea of what was possible and what wasn't In the end it all worked out.

# Features

In this instance of the app I only added trailers, movie bios, actors and their bio, and If that's not enough information I added IMDb links to the movies so you can head there for more info. This is more like an IMDb clone as to Netflix clone;

# Take Aways

While Building this project I learned EJS of course and really improved my JavaScript skills of dealing with large amounts of data and also time and code management because apps can get big very fast.

> Feel free to download, fork or clone this repository as it is just a practice project at this point and if you find any bugs you want me to look at hit me up on you know what to do.:wink:
